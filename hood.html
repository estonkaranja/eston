    <p>Barack Obama has spoken often of his multicultural background: his father was from Kenya, his mother from Kansas, and they met while at the University of Hawaii. After his parents divorced and his father returned to Africa, Obama stayed with his mother and was raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.

He then joined the Chicago law firm of Miner, Barnhill & Galland, which specialized in civil rights legislation. He also taught constitutional law for 12 years at the University of Chicago. </p>
